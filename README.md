# WorkTogether-Cast (formerly known as SchillerCast)
This software allows you to make use of larger screens to present and show documents over the network.

**Note:** Your mobile device must be able to establish a direct connection to the remote device.

**Note:** A mobile device is required to draw. All documents displayed via WorkTogether-Cast are read-only and cannot be saved on the receiving device.

## How to use
The displaying device will be called *remote device*, while the Android device running WorkTogether will be called *mobile device*.

1. **On the remote device:** Start WorkTogether-Cast by executing the *.jar*-file.
2. **On your mobile device:** Open a document or create a new one.
3. **On your mobile device:** On the drawing screen, open the menu in the top-right corner of the screen and select *Connect to a PC/projector using Schiller-Cast*.
4. **On your mobile device:** Enter the address or device name, being displayed on your remote device. Then, tap *OK*.
5. A white rectangle should appear on the screen of your remote device. After a few seconds, your document will be synchronized.

### Closing the connection
To close the connection to your remote device, simply return to the main menu, close the app or connect to a new device.

**Note:** WorkTogether-Cast will not automatically be closed when the connection is closed. You can exit WorkTogether-Cast at any time by pressing *Esc* on your keyboard.
